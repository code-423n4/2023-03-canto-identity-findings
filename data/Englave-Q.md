L01. Missing `IAddressRegistry` import in `ProfilePicture`
The `IAddressRegistry` interface is referenced in the 'getPFP' function, but the smart contract is missing the required import statement for this interface. To resolve this issue, include the appropriate import statement for the `IAddressRegistry` interface at the beginning of the contract file.
By importing the `IAddressRegistry` interface, the contract will have access to the necessary functions and data types for interacting with an `IAddressRegistry` implementation. This ensures that the contract code is correct and avoids any compilation or runtime errors related to the missing import.

L02. Missing immutable modifier for `subprotocolName` in `ProfilePicture`
The `subprotocolName` variable is only initialized in the constructor but is not marked as immutable. Since the value of `subprotocolName` is set during contract deployment and does not change afterward, it is recommended to mark it as immutable to optimize gas usage and ensure that the value remains constant throughout the contract's lifecycle.

To resolve this issue, add the immutable keyword to the `subprotocolName` variable declaration:
```
string public immutable subprotocolName;
```

By marking `subprotocolName` as immutable, you ensure that the variable's value is constant and cannot be modified after the contract's deployment, which helps prevent any unintended changes to the subprotocol name. Additionally, this optimization reduces gas costs, as the value is stored directly in the contract's bytecode instead of in storage.
